All of my wishes and all my demands
All of my dreams
and my best-made plans
All set on fire by your two hands
Oh, love, mmm
I don't know the difference
between love and war
Like smashing a bottle or
slamming the door
Like kissing your neck or
hearing you sing
Oh, love ruins everything
Oh, love is a weapon, my love
So don't ever question or
push me to lessen my love
Busted to pieces, now what do I do?
Tell me you love me,
oh, tell me the truth
'Cause I'm like the ocean
and you're like the moon
Oh, and love ruins everything,
not for you
Mmm
Oh, love is a bottomless pit
And because of you,
now I'm falling forever in it
Oh, love is a weapon, my love
So don't ever question or
push me to lessen my love
Love ruins everything
Oh, love ruins everything
Often my thoughts turn back
to days of childhood
And I can see my simple country home
My father and mother,
sisters and brothers
I never dreamed how far we'd roam
But long years have passed,
and we have wandered
And some now rest within their tombs
But oh,
I wanna be with that happy household
Up there in Heaven beyond this gloom
We used to gather
around the fireside
And the soft light fell
on little faces fair
And we'd laugh and play
and love each other
Our hearts were young
and free from all care
And at night,
we'd say our "now I lay me"s
And Mom,
she'd sweetly tuck us all in bed
Yes, I wanna be with that happy family
When Jesus wakes us from the dead
Gracious, sacred scenes unfold
