[00:10.36] All of my life I've been hunting
[00:12.22] I've been a girl, I've been a boy
[00:14.15] Digging my feet into the ground
[00:15.73] Like an apple tree
[00:16.82] Wanting to live with a purpose
[00:31.82] 
[00:20.64] Skin is a word, love is not a sin
[00:22.40] People are bad, people are good
[00:24.30] Just like the moon is a stone
[00:25.91] But it's a star when it's dark
[00:27.22] And now she's hiding
[00:37.22] 
[00:30.83] If you've seen what a heart is
[00:33.09] You've seen its colour
[00:35.88] If I ever knew how we could guide it
[00:53.88] 
[00:40.67] I would take care of its children
[00:43.35] Become their mother
[00:45.90] If I ever knew how we could hide it
[00:49.83] Hide it
[00:53.33] 
[00:51.44] Let her save the world
[00:54.16] She is just a girl
[00:56.29] Let him save them all
[00:59.28] He is just a boy
[01:07.28] 
[01:01.30] Let her save the world
[01:04.09] She is just a girl
[01:06.47] Let him save them all
[01:09.35] He is just a boy
[01:17.35] 
[01:16.79] Hunger is quiet, if you do it right
[01:18.99] Hunter is loud and predictable
[01:20.23] Scaring away every prey
[01:22.10] So they are gone
[01:22.96] Before the hunter arrives
[01:35.46] 
[01:26.89] Would you be kind, and put away your sword
[01:29.07] You cannot cut away what we got
[01:30.59] You cannot kill what we are
[01:32.44] We are not here
[01:34.00] In physical form
[01:42.00] 
[01:37.21] You've seen where the knife is
[01:39.99] Its dark location
[01:42.51] If I ever knew how we could fight it
[01:45.72] (Fight it)
[01:50.72] 
[01:46.80] I would cut into our anger
[01:50.13] Make pure emotion
[01:52.65] If I ever knew how we could hide it
[01:56.00] Hide it
[01:59.50] 
[01:57.72] Let her save the world
[02:00.62] She is just a girl
[02:02.75] Let him save them all
[02:05.42] He is just a boy
[02:13.42] 
[02:07.86] Let her save the world
[02:10.40] She is just a girl
[02:12.89] Let him save them all
[02:15.55] He is just a boy
[02:23.55] 
[02:32.38] Can you carry the weight of mortality?
[02:38.19] The explosions around you are your symphony
[02:59.69] 
[02:41.05] Let her save the world
[02:43.74] She is just a girl
[02:45.84] Let him save them all
[02:48.84] He is just a boy
[02:56.84] 
[02:50.94] Let her save the world
[02:53.88] She is just a girl
[02:56.24] Let him save them all
[02:59.11] He is just a boy
