I have something to tell you
About the apples in the tree
And how sweet they all could be,
Oh won't you have a bite?
Why don't we lay down right here,
Just until the sun goes down
Wouldn't that be nice?
If you're ever feeling lost
And you don't know where to go,
Just tilt your head up to the sky
You never ever need to cry.
Stars will show you the way back
And no matter where you are
You'll always have a home.
One day, one sunny day,
You'll call this world your own
And jump into the wilderness all by yourself
Just remember,
even if you're no longer by my side,
Always laugh, and let me know you're alright.
I have something to tell you,
There will be some stormy days
You'll find someone who'll break your heart,
Remember them from time to time
But don't worry, be happy,
Everything will be just fine
Everything will be fine.
I know one day when you're older,
You'll leave this home to fly
To find a way, a dream, and a life of your own
Just remember,
even if I'm no longer by your side,
I'll be here underneath the apple tree.
One day, one sunny day,
You'll call this world your own
And jump into the wilderness all by yourself
Just remember,
even if you're no longer by my side,
Always laugh, and let me know you're alright.
