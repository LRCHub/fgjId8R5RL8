I used to sit in a big apple tree
Welcome the sun as he shone down on me
Watch the fruit ripen, smell the land grow
Felt the fall rains get colder and turn into snow

And then in the summer, I'd walk through the trees
Roll up my trousers way over my knees
Waded a stream 'til the rocks hurt my feet
The water was cool, and the summer was sweet

Autumn got lonely when harvest came 'round
Green leaves turned golden and fell to the ground
Clear nights got colder, with the stars bright above
And in the winter, I first fell in love

She loved me truly 'til winter passed by
Left without warning and never said why
Maybe she's lonely, needs me somewhere
Maybe by summer, I won't even care
