I can't help thinking you're a nasty girl
You tickle me baby, when you tease my pearl
If you search inside of me you will find the key
So let's make love under the apple tree

Now it's the middle of the night
I guess that makes it alright
Honey just you and me

Now it's the middle of the night
I guess that makes it alright
Honey just you and me

Now it's the middle of the night
I guess that makes it alright
Now it's the middle of the night
I guess that makes it alright

Say hey good looking
What you got cooking
I'll let you heat it up to a high degree
Yeah, you can be on the top if you ask me please
So let's make love under the apple tree

Now it's the middle of the night
I guess that makes it alright
Honey just you and me

Now it's the middle of the night
I guess that makes it alright
Honey just you and me

Now it's the middle of the night
I guess that makes it alright
Now it's the middle of the night
